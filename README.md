# hello-world
my first repository

I'm new here, expecting to learn some new things.
My initial goal is to do some projects to examine my coding level,
and enjoy the sense of accomplishment.

Welcome  to discuss with me.
Probably I know nothing at all, but I'm willing to learn.

Hope I'm happy with github int the next freshman year.
